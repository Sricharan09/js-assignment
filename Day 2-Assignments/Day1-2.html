        <h2>The Difference among Var,Let and Const </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped</li>
            <li>while let and const are block scoped </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
        <b>Example for Var</b>
            <p>The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “var” is limited to the “function” within which it is
                defined.<br>If it is defined outside any function, the scope of the variable is global.
                var is “function scoped”.</p>
        <script>
            
            {
                var a=17;
                console.log("var a:",a);
            }
            //block 1
            {
                a++;
                console.log("var a:",a);
            }
            //block 2
            /* Since we are using "var a=17", scope of "a" is limited to the function within which it is defined. In this case it is within the global function scope */
        </script>
        <b>Example for Let</b>
        <p>The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “let” or “const” is limited to the “block” defined by
            curly braces i.e. {}.</p>
        
        <script>
          
            {
                let b=20;
                console.log("let b :",b);
            }
           
            //block 1
            {
                b++;
                console.log("let b :",b);
            }
            //block 2
            /* Since we are using "let b=20", scope of "b" is limited to block 1 and "b" is not recognized in block 2 */
            
        </script>
        <b> Example For const</b>
        <p>The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “const” is limited to the block defined by curly
            braces. However if a variable is defined with keyword const, it cannot be reassigned.<br>
            “const” cannot be re-assigned to a new value. However it <b>CAN</b> be mutated.

                const PI=3.14;
                console.log("const PI :",PI);
            }
            //block 1
            {
                console.log("const PI :",PI);
            }
            //block 2
            /* Since we are using "const PI=3.14", scope of "PI" is limited to block 1 and "PI" is not recognized in block 2 */
